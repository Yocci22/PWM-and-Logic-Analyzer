# PWM-and-Logic-Analyzer

lease read some information about PWM techniques and applications in Internet resources (such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation, https://electricalfundablog.com/pulse-width-modulation/, ...) and find an application that you are interested in. And generate the PWM waveforms for the applications, which can be observed using a logic analyzer. Show some waveform observations in your Demo to TA.

使用CubeIDE设定TIM2定时器，设定GPIO，输出给LED1

使用Logic-Analyzer读取波形，并在电脑上显示
